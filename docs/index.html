    <p>Pokémon is a popular franchise that originated in Japan and has since gained global recognition. Pokémon features fictional creatures called Pokémon, which come in various types, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The Pokémon.csv dataset contains information about these creatures, including their names, primary types (Type 1), secondary types (Type 2), and various attributes such as total stats, HP, attack, defense, special attack, special defense, and speed. Additionally, it includes the generation the Pokémon belongs to and a categorical variable indicating whether the Pokémon is legendary. Pokémon. </p>

  <h1>What Pokemon Types are associated with Pokemon strength?</h1>
  <p>Let's begin to answer this question by seeing how each of the strongest Pokemons in each Primary type compare:</p>
  <h1>Strongest Pokémon by Type</h1>
    <svg id="chart1" width="960" height="600"></svg>
  <div class="description">
    <p>This visualization represents the strongest Pokémon of each type in the "Type 1" based on their total stats. The bars indicate the total stats of the strongest Pokémon for each type, and the labels below the bars show the names of these Pokémon. We can see that  the bars representing the strongest Pokémon of Dragon and Psychic types surpass the strength of every other "strongest" Pokémon across all types. However, we only took primary types into account, what about secondary types?</p>
  </div>
    
  <h1>Pokémon Count by Type</h1>
    <svg id="chart2" width="960" height="600"></svg>
  <div class="description">
      <p>This visualization represents the count of the Pokémon for each type in the "Type 1" column. The bars indicate the total stats of the strongest Pokémon for each type, and the labels below the bars show the names of these Pokémon.</p>
  </div>

  <h1>Pokémon Type Distribution</h1>
    <svg id="chart3" width="960" height="600"></svg>
  <div class="description">
      <p>This visualization shows the distribution of Pokémon types based on whether they have one type or two types. The pie chart highlights the portion of Pokémon with one type compared to those with two types. We can see that pokemons with two types outnumber those that only have one type.</p>
  </div>

  <h1>Top 15 Pokémon Type Combinations</h1>
    <svg id="chart4" width="960" height="600"></svg>
  <div class="description">
    <p>This visualization shows the top 15 most popular combinations of Pokémon types that have both a "Type 1" and a "Type 2". The chart is interactive and allows you to explore the different type combinations of Pokémon, making it both informative and fun!</p>
  </div>
  <p>Seems like the most popular type combination is Normal & Flying, let's see if this combination ranks amongst the strongest of all type combinations.</p>

  <h1>Top 15 Strongest Pokémon Type Combinations</h1>
    <svg id="chart5" width="960" height="600"></svg>
  <div class="description">
    <p>This visualization represents the top 15 strongest Pokémon type combinations measured by the "Total" column. We can see that the strongest Pokemon type combination is Ground & Fire! Interesting to see that this combination is not in the top 15 most popular type combinations.</p>
    <pre>Our observations: None of the most popular type combinations were in the strongest combinations --> popularity does not gaurantee strength
                  With fewer than six Pokémon possessing the Ground & Fire combinations, the rankings could be skewed by exceptionally powerful pokemon
                  11 out of the top 15 strongest combinations included the "Dragon" type, which supports the observations made in our first visualization
