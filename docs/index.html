    <p>Pokémon are a group of pokemon with special abilities from the Nintendo-developed game Pokémon. They are named so because in the game players can catch wild Pokémon with their Pokeballs. The game has been in development for over 20 years now and there are over 1,000 Pokémon species in the game now created. While this sounds very cool, so many Pokémon can be hard for new players to memorize and make sense of their relationships. So as big fans of Pokémon, we created this Pokémon Primer website to teach new players the types of Pokémon, the distribution and role of their attributes, and the usefulness of various values in actual Pokémon battles. We hope that after browsing our website, you will have some understanding of Pokémon and become interested in playing the game!</p>

    <p>This visualization represents the strongest Pokémon of each type in the "Type 1" based on their total stats. The data is derived from a dataset containing information about various Pokémon, including their types and total stats. The bars indicate the total stats of the strongest Pokémon for each type, and the labels below the bars show the names of these Pokémon.</p>
